# Welcome to Mikey's Games

Mikey's Games is a project to create a fun family game "console" that uses your family TV and eveyrone's
tablets and phones as controllers. It's not the next Playstation or XBox, it's a way to make traditional
family board games a little more fun by gathering everyone in the same room for some old fashioned types
of games.

The "console" is just a dice-shaped box for a Raspberry Pi that plugs into the TV. The Raspberry Pi both
drives the display of the TV, but also a web browser that the players connect to.

Then the players use the web browser on their devices (or even laptops), to connect to the game server.     

# Status and TODO List
